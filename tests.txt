Even if there were no any problems during the execution only one duck egg has seemed to be growing (moving something in within). 
The others has remained "untouched".

Conclusions/experiences:
- the infrared lamp is too big and it is too close to the eggs within the box which causes the temperature is too concentrated.
  => build in a heating wire instead of using the infrared lamp.
- the box is not well enough insulated so the lamp was turned on and off in ca. every 20 seconds.
  => insulation must be checked and repaired.
- the elapsed time was missing from the display. I had to login with ssh each time to know what the process does.
  => the phase and the elapsed time in hours should be displayed along with the temperature and the humidity.
- the one duck egg was only on the half way of growing at the end of the process.
  => a.) investigate how much job must be done to allow the configuration parameters (progwheel.xml) be modifiable on-the-fly.
  => b.) give only one step and set it to 40 days of running or more.
- DHT22 is the most cheap but may be not the best sensor for this purpose.
  => another more precise sensor should be used.
